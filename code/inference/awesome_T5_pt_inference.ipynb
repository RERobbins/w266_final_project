The story is told in the Bible 's Books of Samuel ( 1 Samuel 17 ) . \\n \\n The original purpose of the story was to show David 's identity as the true king of Israel . Post-Classical Jewish traditions stressed Goliath 's status as the representative of paganism , in contrast to David , the champion of the God of Israel . Christian tradition gave him a distinctively Christian perspective , seeing in David 's battle with Goliath the victory of God 's king over the enemies of God 's helpless people as a prefiguring of Jesus ' victory over sin on the cross and the Church 's victory over Satan . \\n \\n The phrase `` David and Goliath '' has taken on a more secular meaning , denoting an underdog situation , a contest where a smaller , weaker opponent faces a much bigger , stronger adversary . \\n \\n Biblical account \\n \\n The Goliath narrative in 1 Samuel 17 \\n \\n The account of the battle between David and Goliath is told in 1 Samuel , chapter 17 . Saul and the Israelites are facing the Philistines near the Valley of Elah . Twice a day for 40 days , Goliath , the champion of the Philistines , comes out between the lines and challenges the Israelites to send out a champion of their own to decide the outcome in single combat , but Saul and all the Israelites are afraid . David , bringing food for his elder brothers , hears that Goliath had defied the armies of God and of the reward from Saul to the one that defeats him , and accepts the challenge . Saul reluctantly agrees and offers his armor , which David declines , taking only his staff , sling ( q\\u0101la \\u2018 ) and five stones from a brook . \\n \\n David and Goliath confront each other , Goliath with his armor and javelin , David with his staff and sling . `` The Philistine cursed David by his gods '' , but David replies : `` This day the will deliver you into my hand , and I will strike you down ; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth ; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel , and that all this assembly may know that God saves not with sword and spear ; for the battle is God \\u2019 s , and he will give you into our hand . '' \\n \\n David hurls a stone from his sling with all his might and hits Goliath in the center of his forehead , Goliath falls on his face to the ground , and David cuts off his head . The Philistines flee and are pursued by the Israelites `` as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron '' . David puts the armor of Goliath in his own tent and takes the head to Jerusalem , and Saul sends Abner to bring the boy to him . The king asks whose son he is , and David answers , `` I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite . '' \\n \\n Composition of the Book of Samuel and the Goliath narrative \\n \\n The Book of Samuel , together with the books of Joshua , Judges and Kings , make up a unified history of Israel stretching from the entry into Canaan to the early Babylonian exile of the 6th century BCE , which biblical scholars call the Deuteronomistic history . The first edition of the history was probably written at the court of Judah 's King Josiah ( late 7th century ) and a revised second edition during the exile ( 6th century ) , with further revisions in the post-exilic period . The Goliath story contains the traces of this in its many contradictions and illogicalities - to take a few examples , Saul finds it necessary to send for David when as the king 's shield-bearer he should already be beside his royal master , and he has to ask who David is , which sits strangely with David 's status at his court . These signs indicate that the Goliath story is made up of base-narrative with numerous additions made probably after the exile . \\n \\n Original\",\n\"When David killed Goliath, how many of his five stones did he use?\"],\n [{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        },\n\"generate question: answer: Apaches context: Geronimo ( `` the one who yawns '' ; June 16 , 1829 \\u2013 February 17 , 1909 ) was a prominent leader from the Bedonkohe band of the Chiricahua Apache tribe . From 1850 to 1886 Geronimo joined with members of three other Chiricahua Apache bands\\u2014the Chihenne , the Chokonen and the Nednhi\\u2014to carry out numerous raids as well as resistance to US and Mexican military campaigns in the northern Mexico states of Chihuahua and Sonora , and in the southwestern American territories of New Mexico and Arizona . Geronimo 's raids and related combat actions were a part of the prolonged period of the Apache-American conflict , that started with American settlement in Apache lands following the end of the war with Mexico in 1848 . The Apache-American conflict was itself a direct outgrowth of the much older Apache-Mexican conflict which had been ongoing in the same general area since the beginning of Mexican/Spanish settlement in the 1600s . \\n \\n During the centuries of Apache-Mexican and Apache-American conflict , raiding had become embedded in the Apache way of life , used not only for strategic purposes but also as an economic enterprise , and often there was overlap between raids for economic need and warfare . Raids ranged from stealing livestock and other plunder , to the capture and/or violent killing of victims , sometimes by torture . Mexicans and Americans responded with retaliation attacks against the Apache which were no less violent , and were often indiscriminate . The raiding and retaliation fed the fires of a virulent revenge warfare that reverberated back and forth between Apaches and Mexicans and later , Apaches and Americans . This was a deadly , brutal and barbaric business for all sides . From 1850 to 1886 Geronimo as well as other Apache leaders conducted raids and carried on revenge warfare , but Geronimo accumulated a record during this time that matched any of his contemporaries , and his fighting ability extending over 30 years form a major characteristic of his persona . \\n \\n Geronimo was not counted a chief among the Apache . At any one time , only about 30 to 50 Apaches would be numbered among his personal following . However , since he was a superb leader in raiding and revenge warfare he frequently led numbers larger than his own following . Among Geronimo 's own Chiricahua tribe many had mixed feelings about him\\u2014while respected as a skilled and effective leader of raids or warfare , he emerges as not very likable , and he was not widely popular among the other Apache . Nevertheless , Apache people stood in awe of Geronimo 's `` powers '' which he demonstrated to them on a series of occasions . These powers indicated to other Apaches that Geronimo had super-natural gifts that he could use for good or ill . In eye-witness accounts by other Apaches , Geronimo was able to become aware of distant events as they happened , and he was able to anticipate events that were in the future . He also demonstrated powers to heal other Apaches . \\n \\n Early in his life , Geronimo became invested in the continuing and relentless cycle of revenge warfare between Apache and Mexican . On March 5 , 1851 , when Geronimo was in his 20 's , a force of Mexican militia from Sonora under Colonel Jose Maria Carrasco attacked and surprised an Apache camp outside of Janos , Chihuahua , slaughtering the inhabitants which included Geronimo 's family . Col. Carrasco claimed he had followed the Apaches to Janos , Chihuahua after they had conducted a raid in Sonora , taken livestock and other plunder and badly defeated Mexican militia . Geronimo was absent at the time of the attack on the Apache camp , but when he returned he found that his mother , wife , and his three children were among the dead . In retaliation , Geronimo joined in an extended series of revenge attacks against the Mexicans . This event left Geronimo with a bitter and very personal hatred for Mexicans , and he often killed them indiscriminately and with a special vehemence . Throughout Geronimo 's adult life his antipathy , suspicion and dislike for Mexicans was demonstrably greater than for Americans . \\n \\n During Geronimo 's final period of conflict from 1876 to 1886 he `` surrendered '' three times and accepted life on the Apache reservations in Arizona . Reservation life was confining to the free-moving Apache people , and they resented restrictions on their customary way of life . While Apaches were shielded from the violence of warfare on the reservation , disability and death from diseases like malaria was much more prevalent .\",\n\"Of which tribe of Red Indians was Geronimo a chief\"]],\n        columns: [[\"number\", \"index\"], [\"string\", \"orig\"], [\"string\", \"target\"]],\n        columnOptions: [{\"width\": \"1px\", \"className\": \"index_column\"}],\n        rowsPerPage: 25,\n        helpUrl: \"https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/data_table.ipynb\",\n        suppressOutputScrolling: true,\n        minimumWidth: undefined,\n      });\n    "

The story is told in the Bible 's Books of Samuel ( 1 Samuel 17 ) . \\n \\n The original purpose of the story was to show David 's identity as the true king of Israel . Post-Classical Jewish traditions stressed Goliath 's status as the representative of paganism , in contrast to David , the champion of the God of Israel . Christian tradition gave him a distinctively Christian perspective , seeing in David 's battle with Goliath the victory of God 's king over the enemies of God 's helpless people as a prefiguring of Jesus ' victory over sin on the cross and the Church 's victory over Satan . \\n \\n The phrase `` David and Goliath '' has taken on a more secular meaning , denoting an underdog situation , a contest where a smaller , weaker opponent faces a much bigger , stronger adversary . \\n \\n Biblical account \\n \\n The Goliath narrative in 1 Samuel 17 \\n \\n The account of the battle between David and Goliath is told in 1 Samuel , chapter 17 . Saul and the Israelites are facing the Philistines near the Valley of Elah . Twice a day for 40 days , Goliath , the champion of the Philistines , comes out between the lines and challenges the Israelites to send out a champion of their own to decide the outcome in single combat , but Saul and all the Israelites are afraid . David , bringing food for his elder brothers , hears that Goliath had defied the armies of God and of the reward from Saul to the one that defeats him , and accepts the challenge . Saul reluctantly agrees and offers his armor , which David declines , taking only his staff , sling ( q\\u0101la \\u2018 ) and five stones from a brook . \\n \\n David and Goliath confront each other , Goliath with his armor and javelin , David with his staff and sling . `` The Philistine cursed David by his gods '' , but David replies : `` This day the will deliver you into my hand , and I will strike you down ; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth ; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel , and that all this assembly may know that God saves not with sword and spear ; for the battle is God \\u2019 s , and he will give you into our hand . '' \\n \\n David hurls a stone from his sling with all his might and hits Goliath in the center of his forehead , Goliath falls on his face to the ground , and David cuts off his head . The Philistines flee and are pursued by the Israelites `` as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron '' . David puts the armor of Goliath in his own tent and takes the head to Jerusalem , and Saul sends Abner to bring the boy to him . The king asks whose son he is , and David answers , `` I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite . '' \\n \\n Composition of the Book of Samuel and the Goliath narrative \\n \\n The Book of Samuel , together with the books of Joshua , Judges and Kings , make up a unified history of Israel stretching from the entry into Canaan to the early Babylonian exile of the 6th century BCE , which biblical scholars call the Deuteronomistic history . The first edition of the history was probably written at the court of Judah 's King Josiah ( late 7th century ) and a revised second edition during the exile ( 6th century ) , with further revisions in the post-exilic period . The Goliath story contains the traces of this in its many contradictions and illogicalities - to take a few examples , Saul finds it necessary to send for David when as the king 's shield-bearer he should already be beside his royal master , and he has to ask who David is , which sits strangely with David 's status at his court . These signs indicate that the Goliath story is made up of base-narrative with numerous additions made probably after the exile . \\n \\n Original\",\n\" one \",\n\"When David killed Goliath, how many of his five stones did he use?\",\n\"What was his first battle?\"],\n [{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        },\n\"Geronimo ( `` the one who yawns '' ; June 16 , 1829 \\u2013 February 17 , 1909 ) was a prominent leader from the Bedonkohe band of the Chiricahua Apache tribe . From 1850 to 1886 Geronimo joined with members of three other Chiricahua Apache bands\\u2014the Chihenne , the Chokonen and the Nednhi\\u2014to carry out numerous raids as well as resistance to US and Mexican military campaigns in the northern Mexico states of Chihuahua and Sonora , and in the southwestern American territories of New Mexico and Arizona . Geronimo 's raids and related combat actions were a part of the prolonged period of the Apache-American conflict , that started with American settlement in Apache lands following the end of the war with Mexico in 1848 . The Apache-American conflict was itself a direct outgrowth of the much older Apache-Mexican conflict which had been ongoing in the same general area since the beginning of Mexican/Spanish settlement in the 1600s . \\n \\n During the centuries of Apache-Mexican and Apache-American conflict , raiding had become embedded in the Apache way of life , used not only for strategic purposes but also as an economic enterprise , and often there was overlap between raids for economic need and warfare . Raids ranged from stealing livestock and other plunder , to the capture and/or violent killing of victims , sometimes by torture . Mexicans and Americans responded with retaliation attacks against the Apache which were no less violent , and were often indiscriminate . The raiding and retaliation fed the fires of a virulent revenge warfare that reverberated back and forth between Apaches and Mexicans and later , Apaches and Americans . This was a deadly , brutal and barbaric business for all sides . From 1850 to 1886 Geronimo as well as other Apache leaders conducted raids and carried on revenge warfare , but Geronimo accumulated a record during this time that matched any of his contemporaries , and his fighting ability extending over 30 years form a major characteristic of his persona . \\n \\n Geronimo was not counted a chief among the Apache . At any one time , only about 30 to 50 Apaches would be numbered among his personal following . However , since he was a superb leader in raiding and revenge warfare he frequently led numbers larger than his own following . Among Geronimo 's own Chiricahua tribe many had mixed feelings about him\\u2014while respected as a skilled and effective leader of raids or warfare , he emerges as not very likable , and he was not widely popular among the other Apache . Nevertheless , Apache people stood in awe of Geronimo 's `` powers '' which he demonstrated to them on a series of occasions . These powers indicated to other Apaches that Geronimo had super-natural gifts that he could use for good or ill . In eye-witness accounts by other Apaches , Geronimo was able to become aware of distant events as they happened , and he was able to anticipate events that were in the future . He also demonstrated powers to heal other Apaches . \\n \\n Early in his life , Geronimo became invested in the continuing and relentless cycle of revenge warfare between Apache and Mexican . On March 5 , 1851 , when Geronimo was in his 20 's , a force of Mexican militia from Sonora under Colonel Jose Maria Carrasco attacked and surprised an Apache camp outside of Janos , Chihuahua , slaughtering the inhabitants which included Geronimo 's family . Col. Carrasco claimed he had followed the Apaches to Janos , Chihuahua after they had conducted a raid in Sonora , taken livestock and other plunder and badly defeated Mexican militia . Geronimo was absent at the time of the attack on the Apache camp , but when he returned he found that his mother , wife , and his three children were among the dead . In retaliation , Geronimo joined in an extended series of revenge attacks against the Mexicans . This event left Geronimo with a bitter and very personal hatred for Mexicans , and he often killed them indiscriminately and with a special vehemence . Throughout Geronimo 's adult life his antipathy , suspicion and dislike for Mexicans was demonstrably greater than for Americans . \\n \\n During Geronimo 's final period of conflict from 1876 to 1886 he `` surrendered '' three times and accepted life on the Apache reservations in Arizona . Reservation life was confining to the free-moving Apache people , and they resented restrictions on their customary way of life . While Apaches were shielded from the violence of warfare on the reservation , disability and death from diseases like malaria was much more prevalent .\",\n\" Apaches \",\n\"Of which tribe of Red Indians was Geronimo a chief\",\n\"What was his first battle?\"],\n [{\n            'v': 2,\n            'f': \"2\",\n        },\n\"In Jewish eschatology the term mashiach , or `` Messiah '' , came to refer to a future Jewish king from the Davidic line , who is expected to be anointed with holy anointing oil and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age .

The country is located on the island of Hispaniola , in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean . It occupies the western three-eighths of the island which it shares with the Dominican Republic . Haiti is 27750 km2 in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people , making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole . \\n \\n Originally inhabited by the indigenous Ta\\u00edno people , Spain first became aware of the island on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus across the Atlantic . When Columbus initially landed in Haiti , he had thought he had found India or Asia . On Christmas day , Columbus ' flagship the Santa Maria , ran aground north of what is now Limonade . As a consequence , Columbus ordered his men to salvage what they could from the ship , and he created the first European settlement in the Americas , naming it La Navidad after the day the ship was destroyed . [ 2 ] \\n \\n The island was named La Espa\\u00f1ola and claimed by Spain , which ruled until the early 17th century . Competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France , which named it Saint-Domingue . The development of sugarcane plantations , worked by slaves brought from Africa , led to the colony being among the most lucrative in the world . \\n \\n In the midst of the French Revolution ( 1789-1799 ) , slaves and free people of colour revolted in the Haitian Revolution ( 1791-1804 ) , culminating in the abolition of slavery and the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte 's army at the Battle of Verti\\u00e8res . Afterward the sovereign nation of Haiti was established on 1 January 1804 - the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean , the second republic in the Americas , the only nation in the western hemisphere to have defeated three European superpowers ( Britain , France and Spain ) , and the only nation in the world established as a result of a successful slave revolt . The rebellion that began in 1791 was led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army , Toussaint Louverture , whose military genius and political acumen transformed an entire society of slaves into an independent country . Upon his death in a prison in France , he was succeeded by his lieutenant , Jean-Jacques Dessalines , who declared Haiti 's sovereignty and later became the first Emperor of Haiti , Jacques I . The Haitian Revolution lasted nearly a decade ; and apart from Alexandre P\\u00e9tion , the first President of the Republic , all the first leaders of government were former slaves . The Citadelle Laferri\\u00e8re is the largest fortress in the Americas . Henri Christophe - former slave and first king of Haiti , Henri I - built it to withstand a possible foreign attack . \\n \\n In addition to CARICOM , Haiti is a member of the Latin Union , the Organization of American States , and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States ; it is also seeking associate membership status in the African Union . It has the lowest Human Development Index in the Americas . Most recently , in February 2004 , a coup d'\\u00e9tat originating in the north of the country forced the resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . A provisional government took control with security provided by the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti ( MINUSTAH ) . Michel Martelly , the previous president , was elected in the 2011 general election . \\n \\n Etymology \\n \\n The name Ha\\u00efti ( or Hayti ) comes from the indigenous Ta\\u00edno language which was the native name given to the entire island of Hispaniola to mean , `` land of high mountains . '' The h is silent in French and the \\u00ef in Ha\\u00efti , is a diacritical mark used to show that the second vowel is pronounced separately , as in the word na\\u00efve . In English , the rules for the pronunciation is often disregarded , thus the spelling Haiti is used and pronounced as `` Hay-ti '' . \\n \\n The name Ha\\u00efti was restored by Haitian revolutionary Jean-Jacques Dessalines as the official name of independent Saint-Domingue , as a tribute to the Amerindian predecessors . \\n \\n In French , Haiti 's nickname is the Pearl\",\n\" La Espa\\u00f1ola \",\n\"What island is shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic?\",\n\"What was his first political he did?\"],\n [{\n            'v': 4,\n            'f': \"4\",\n        },\n\"Hyposmia is a reduced ability to smell and to detect odors .

By mechanically moving the parts to the assembly work and moving the semi-finished assembly from work station to work station , a finished product can be assembled faster and with less labor than by having workers carry parts to a stationary piece for assembly . \\n \\n Assembly lines are common methods of assembling complex items such as automobiles and other transportation equipment , household appliances and electronic goods . \\n \\n Concept \\n \\n Assembly lines are designed for the sequential organization of workers , tools or machines , and parts . The motion of workers is minimized to the extent possible . All parts or assemblies are handled either by conveyors or motorized vehicles such as fork lifts , or gravity , with no manual trucking . Heavy lifting is done by machines such as overhead cranes or fork lifts . Each worker typically performs one simple operation . \\n \\n According to Henry Ford : \\n \\n Simple example \\n \\n Consider the assembly of a car : assume that certain steps in the assembly line are to install the engine , install the hood , and install the wheels ( in that order , with arbitrary interstitial steps ) ; only one of these steps can be done at a time . In traditional production , only one car would be assembled at a time . If engine installation takes 20 minutes , hood installation takes five minutes , and wheels installation takes 10 minutes , then a car can be produced every 35 minutes . \\n \\n In an assembly line , car assembly is split between several stations , all working simultaneously . When one station is finished with a car , it passes it on to the next . By having three stations , a total of three different cars can be operated on at the same time , each one at a different stage of its assembly . \\n \\n After finishing its work on the first car , the engine installation crew can begin working on the second car . While the engine installation crew works on the second car , the first car can be moved to the hood station and fitted with a hood , then to the wheels station and be fitted with wheels . After the engine has been installed on the second car , the second car moves to the hood assembly . At the same time , the third car moves to the engine assembly . When the third car \\u2019 s engine has been mounted , it then can be moved to the hood station ; meanwhile , subsequent cars ( if any ) can be moved to the engine installation station . \\n \\n Assuming no loss of time when moving a car from one station to another , the longest stage on the assembly line determines the throughput ( 20 minutes for the engine installation ) so a car can be produced every 20 minutes , once the first car taking 35 minutes has been produced . \\n \\n History \\n \\n Before the Industrial Revolution , most manufactured products were made individually by hand . A single craftsman or team of craftsmen would create each part of a product . They would use their skills and tools such as files and knives to create the individual parts . They would then assemble them into the final product , making cut-and-try changes in the parts until they fit and could work together ( craft production ) . \\n \\n Division of labor was practiced in China where state run monopolies mass-produced metal agricultural implements , china and armor and weapons centuries before it appeared in Europe on the eve of the Industrial Revolution . Adam Smith discussed the division of labour in the manufacture of pins at length in his book The Wealth of Nations ( published in 1776 ) . \\n \\n The Venetian Arsenal , dating to about 1104 , operated similar to a production line . Ships moved down a canal and were fitted by the various shops they passed . At the peak of its efficiency in the early 16th century , the Venetian Arsenal employed some 16,000 people who could apparently produce nearly one ship each day , and could fit out , arm , and provision a newly built galley with standardized parts on an assembly-line basis .

One of 15 Silverplate B-29s used by the 509th , Bockscar was built at the Glenn L.

It was assigned to the 393d Bombardment Squadron , 509th Composite Group to Wendover Army Air Field , Utah in April . \\n \\n Bockscar was used in 13 training and practice missions from Tinian , and three combat missions in which it dropped pumpkin bombs on industrial targets in Japan . On 9 August 1945 , Bockscar , piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron 's commander , Major Charles W. Sweeney , dropped a Fat Man nuclear bomb with a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT over the city of Nagasaki . About 44 % of the city was destroyed ; 35,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured . \\n \\n After the war , Bockscar returned to the United States in November 1945 . In September 1946 it was given to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base , Ohio .

It was one of 10 modified as a Silverplate and re-designated `` Block 36 '' . \\n \\n Silverplate involved extensive modifications to the B-29 to carry nuclear weapons . The bomb bay doors and the fuselage section between the bomb bays were removed to create a single 33 ft bomb bay . British suspensions and bracing were attached for both shape types , with the gun-type suspension anchored in the aft bomb bay and the implosion type mounted in the forward bay . Weight reduction was also accomplished by removal of gun turrets and armor plating . These B-29s also had an improved engine , the R-3350-41 . The Silverplate aircraft represented a significant increase in performance over the standard variants . \\n \\n Delivered to the United States Army Air Forces on 19 March 1945 , Bockscar was assigned to Captain Frederick C.

The word `` coleoptera '' is from the Greek , koleos , meaning `` sheath '' ; and , pteron , meaning `` wing '' , thus `` sheathed wing '' , because most beetles have two pairs of wings , the front pair , the `` elytra '' , being hardened and thickened into a shell-like protection for the rear pair and the beetle 's abdomen . The order contains more species than any other order , constituting almost 25 % of all known life-forms . About 40 % of all described insect species are beetles ( about 400,000 species ) , and new species are discovered frequently . The largest taxonomic family , the Curculionidae ( the weevils or snout beetles ) , also belongs to this order . \\n \\n The diversity of beetles is very wide-ranging . They are found in almost all types of habitats , but are not known to occur in the sea or in the polar regions . They interact with their ecosystems in several ways . They often feed on plants and fungi , break down animal and plant debris , and eat other invertebrates . Some species are prey of various animals including birds and mammals . Certain species are agricultural pests , such as the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata , the boll weevil Anthonomus grandis , the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum , and the mungbean or cowpea beetle Callosobruchus maculatus , while other species of beetles are important controls of agricultural pests . For example , beetles in the family Coccinellidae ( `` ladybirds '' or `` ladybugs '' ) consume aphids , scale insects , thrips , and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops . \\n \\n Species in the order Coleoptera are generally characterized by a particularly hard exoskeleton and hard forewings ( elytra , singular elytron ) . These elytra distinguish beetles from most other insect species , except for a few species of Hemiptera . The beetle 's exoskeleton is made up of numerous plates called sclerites , separated by thin sutures . This design creates the armored defenses of the beetle while maintaining flexibility . The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform , although specific organs and appendages may vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order . Like all insects , beetles ' bodies are divided into three sections : the head , the thorax , and the abdomen . Coleopteran internal morphology is similar to other insects , although there are several examples of novelty . Such examples include species of water beetle which use air bubbles in order to dive under the water , and can remain submerged thanks to passive diffusion as oxygen moves from the water into the bubble . \\n \\n Beetles are endopterygotes , which means that they undergo complete metamorphosis , a biological process by which an animal physically develops after birth or hatching , undergoing a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt change in their body structure . Coleopteran species have an extremely intricate behavior when mating , using such methods as pheromones for communication to locate potential mates . Males may fight for females using very elongated mandibles , causing a strong divergence between males and females in sexual dimorphism . \\n \\n Etymology \\n \\n Coleoptera comes from the Greek koleopteros , literally `` sheath-wing '' , from koleos meaning `` sheath '' , and pteron , meaning `` wing '' . The name was given to the group by Aristotle for their elytra , hardened shield-like forewings . The English name `` beetle '' comes from the Old English word bitela , literally meaning small biter , deriving from the word bitel , which means biting . This word is related to the word b\\u012btan ( to bite ) The name also derives from the Middle English word betylle from Old English bitula ( also meaning to bite ) . Another Old English name for beetle is ceafor , chafer , used in names such as cockchafer , from the Proto-Germanic * kabraz- ( compare German K\\u00e4fer ) .

The provisions of the British Calendar ( New Style ) Act 1750 , implemented in 1752 , altered the official British dating method to the Gregorian calendar with the start of the year on January 1 ( it had been March 25 ) . These changes resulted in dates being moved forward 11 days , and for those between January 1 and March 25 , an advance of one year . For a further explanation , see Old Style and New Style dates . \\u2013 , 1799 ) was the first President of the United States ( 1789\\u201397 ) , the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War , and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States . He presided over the convention that drafted the current United States Constitution and during his lifetime was called the `` father of his country '' . \\n \\n Widely admired for his strong leadership qualities , Washington was unanimously elected president by the Electoral College in the first two national elections . He oversaw the creation of a strong , well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars , suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion , and won acceptance among Americans of all types . Washington 's incumbency established many precedents , still in use today , such as the cabinet system , the inaugural address , and the title Mr. President . His retirement from office after two terms established a tradition that lasted until 1940 , when Franklin Delano Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term . The 22nd Amendment ( 1951 ) now limits the president to two elected terms . Born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia , his family were wealthy planters who owned tobacco plantations and slaves which he inherited . In his youth he became a senior officer in the colonial militia during the first stages of the French and Indian War . In 1775 the Second Continental Congress commissioned Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution . In that command , Washington forced the British out of Boston in 1776 , but was defeated and nearly captured later that year when he lost New York City . After crossing the Delaware River in the middle of winter , he defeated the British in two battles ( Trenton and Princeton ) , retook New Jersey and restored momentum to the Patriot cause . \\n \\n His strategy enabled Continental forces to capture two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781 . Historians laud Washington for the selection and supervision of his generals , preservation and command of the army , coordination with the Congress , state governors and their militia , and attention to supplies , logistics , and training . In battle , however , Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies . After victory had been finalized in 1783 , Washington resigned as commander-in-chief rather than seize power , proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to American republicanism . Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787 , which devised a new form of federal government for the United States . Following his election as president in 1789 , he worked to unify rival factions in the fledgling nation . He supported Alexander Hamilton 's programs to satisfy all debts , federal and state , established a permanent seat of government , implemented an effective tax system , and created a national bank . In avoiding war with Great Britain , he guaranteed a decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795 , despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians . Although he remained nonpartisan , never joining the Federalist Party , he largely supported its policies . Washington 's Farewell Address was an influential primer on civic virtue , warning against partisanship , sectionalism , and involvement in foreign wars . He retired from the presidency in 1797 , returning to his home and plantation at Mount Vernon . \\n \\n While in power , his use of national authority pursued many ends , especially the preservation of liberty , reduction of regional tensions , and promotion of a spirit of American nationalism . Upon his death , Washington was eulogized as `` first in war , first in peace , and first in the hearts of his countrymen '' by Henry Lee . Revered in life and in death , scholarly and public polling consistently ranks him among the top three presidents in American history ; he has been depicted\",\n\" Gregorian calendar \",\n\"When introduced into Britain in 1752, what caused a riot over eleven lost days?\",\n\"What was his first political position?\"]],\n        columns: [[\"number\", \"index\"], [\"string\", \"context\"], [\"string\", \"answer\"], [\"string\", \"target\"], [\"string\", \"prediction\"]],\n        columnOptions: [{\"width\": \"1px\", \"className\": \"index_column\"}],\n        rowsPerPage: 25,\n        helpUrl: \"https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/data_table.ipynb\",\n        suppressOutputScrolling: true,\n        minimumWidth: undefined,\n      });\n    "
